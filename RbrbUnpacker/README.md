# RbrbUnpacker

This is a console resource viewer (& unpacker) for the game.

The program uses some codes from DxLib, and is inspired by GARbro.

This is a personal program and you should not use it illegally.

Useable commands:
* ls: List current or specified directory
* cd: Change or tell working directory
* pwd: Tell current working directory
* cls, clear: Clear the screen
* preview [--force-write]: Unpack a file from the archive and open it in temporary store
* tree [--ignore-file]: List directories and files in a tree-like format
* extract [-i path] [-o path] [--no-original-filetime]: Extract files from the archive to disk

In order to prevent some bad things from happening, the default key is provided by DxLib and the private key is not stored in the code.
