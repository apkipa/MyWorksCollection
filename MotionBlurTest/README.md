# Motion Blur Test
The program is used to test motion blur effect. If you want to have a try, go to releases page.

This program uses a quite easy and stupid way to achieve the effect: Add & divide bitmaps many times, like a camera taking photos.
To speed up the procedure, SSE2 is also used in the program. You can disable it in the code to make a comparison.
